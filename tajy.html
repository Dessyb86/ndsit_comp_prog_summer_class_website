Passion/Interest
</h2>
<h5>
My passion for law stems from its profound impact on society and individuals. I want to study law because it is an ideal career for my personal goals, offers endless complex problems to solve and demands a wide variety of skills. 
<br>
<br>
I'm most passionate about new experiences and cheerleading because cheer teaches you sisterhood.
<br>
<br>
My hobbies are doing hair, cheering, making Tik Tok, going outside with my friends, and sometimes going out for late night drives.
<br>
<br>
I am interested in a lot of different activities and things. Some skills I have are: Leadership, Problem-solving, Communication, Customer Service, teamwork, and many more.
</h5>
<h2>
In the future...
</h2>
<h5>
I see myself meeting all the requirements for me to graduate high school.
<br>
<br>
Then I see myself going to an HBCU(Preferably Spelman) Double Majoring in Law and Business while studying in Political science, English, Criminal Justice. Also, International Business, Finance, and Accounting, staying at college for at least 4 years to get my criminal justice degree and Accounting.
<br>
<br>
Then, going to cosmetology school for 2-3 years to get my diploma and license and from here, I plan on starting my own hair business.
<br>
<br>
I plan on taking more trips in my 20s and 30s, I'm more focused on making my money first and becoming very wealthy so when I retire, I could continue to live my best life without any worries about going bankrupt or anything.
