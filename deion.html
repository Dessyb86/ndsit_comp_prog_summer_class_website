<h2>
Interests
</h2>
<p>
I have a wide range of interests that keep me engaged and entertained. One of my biggest passions is baseball. I've been a fan of the sport since I was a kid, and I love everything about it - from the adrenaline rush of watching a live game to the statistics and strategy behind each play. There's just something about the crack of the bat and the roar of the crowd that gets my heart racing.
<br><br>
In addition to baseball, I'm also a big fan of volleyball. I love the fast-paced action and teamwork involved in the game. Whether I'm playing with friends or watching a professional match, volleyball always keeps me on the edge of my seat.
<br><br>
When it comes to unwinding and having fun, I turn to video games. Whether it's an intense first-person shooter or a thought-provoking puzzle game, I enjoy the immersive experiences and challenges that gaming offers. It's a great way for me to relax and unwind after a long day.
<br><br>
On the more technical side, I have a keen interest in coding. I love the logical problem-solving aspect of it and the satisfaction of building something from scratch. It's a skill that I'm constantly looking to improve, and I'm always excited to learn new coding languages and techniques.

In addition, I have a love for debating. I find that engaging in debates allows me to expand my horizons and consider different perspectives. It's not just about proving a point, but also about understanding and respecting differing opinions. I enjoy the mental stimulation and the opportunity to refine my communication skills through debating.
<br><br>
Another interest of mine is powerscaling, particularly in the context of fictional universes such as anime, comics, and TV shows. I find the concept of comparing and analyzing the strengths and abilities of different characters fascinating. It's a way for me to delve deeper into the fictional worlds that I enjoy and to gain a better understanding of the characters and their capabilities.

Lastly, I find solace in reading comics and immersing myself in the captivating storylines and artwork. There's something special about being transported into a different world through the pages of a comic book. Additionally, I enjoy watching TV shows and anime, as they offer a diverse range of storytelling and visuals that captivate my imagination.

These various interests represent different aspects of my personality and provide me with a well-rounded set of activities to enjoy in my free time. Whether it's the thrill of sports, the mental challenge of coding, the excitement of debating, or the immersion of fictional worlds, each of these interests adds its own unique flavor to my life.
